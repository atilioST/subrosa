## Organization Structure

### Scout (30 people)
Building next-generation agentic platform — harness and infrastructure for autonomous AI agents.

- **Intel**: Data pipelines and context gathering
- **Evals**: Testing and validation framework
- **Storage**: Data persistence layer
- **SharePoint**: Integration connector

## Active Priorities
1. Scout platform development and stabilization
2. Customer pilot programs (RWE, Enfinity, Evyve, Powerhouse)
3. Subsystem integration and reliability
4. Team workflow alignment and process improvement (especially solving PR review backlog)
